      "An Actual DD into GLXY: A fundamentally good stock to buy for now and later. This DD was compiled using company financial data and qualitative analysis. I work in finance but not strictly in investment analysis, so I am not a professional.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Fundamental and Macro Growth Factors for GLXY:\n",
      "\n",
      "* First-mover advantage + pure monopoly on equity tokenization:\n",
      "   * With Kraken, Ondo, Robinhood, etc., tokenized versions of stocks exist as synthetics or derivatives, so GLXY is undisputably first on tokenizing real shares. This is mostly a big deal for institutional investors with policies restricting derivative exposure, as GLXY tokens have full economic and legal rights including corporate actions, dividends, votes, and SEC compliance.\n",
      "* Adoption of tokenized equities *will concretely occur:*\n",
      "   * 24/7 trading, instant settlement, fractional ownership, lower fees, etc., are incredibly valuable, and it helps a lot that the current administration is being extremely crypto-friendly as it helps institutions move more quickly towards tokenized equity.\n",
      "   * Tokenized equities are estimated are projected to reach $190 trillion globally within 20 years.\n",
      "* Galaxy significantly outperformed the broader crypto market in Q2.\n",
      "   * GLXY stock fell 10% after Q2 earnings, which is mostly attributable to a 22% drop in digital asset trading volumes. However, industry-wide, crypto trading volume dropped 30%, which represents a massive out-performance by Galaxy.\n",
      "* Partnership with CoreWeave:\n",
      "   * Galaxy is diversifying away from purely crypto into AI infrastructure. Feel free to read about it [here]( but in short, they’re building a massive high-performance computing / AI data center campus called Helios in Texas. CoreWeave just exercised its option for the full 800 Megawatts of power, which Galaxy says will earn $1 billion annually.\n",
      "      * However, the full Helios center capacity is 3,500 MW, which (scaled linearly) represents $4.375 billion in annual revenue (completely ignoring their crypto business). This is an eye-popping amount of ARR given that Galaxy’s market cap is only $8.6 billion.\n",
      "* Interest rate tailwinds:\n",
      "   * Galaxy beat Q2 revenue estimates (even with lagging crypto trading volume) but missed on EPS. The Helios data campus was just financed with $350 million in equity and an additional $1.4 billion in debt. Interest rates coming down would be a huge tailwind for Galaxy as they can refinance their debt facility at lower rates, cutting costs and bolstering their bottom line.\n",
      "   * Finally, as the opportunity cost of holding most cryptocurrencies comes down, trading activity will increase.\n",
      "* [Analyst opinions](\n",
      "   * Analysts rate GLXY a consensus strong buy (12 analysts buy and 1 analyst hold) with a 12-month target of $36.67 (\\~60% upside from current \\~$23).\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",

      "One more factor for good luck:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Short-term boost:\n",
      "   * [It *just tokenized* its equity this week]( and this gives access to a whole new investor base of crypto natives. This might create a bit of short-term speculative demand, if the crypto-natives decide to treat GLXY like they treat cryptocurrencies.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, GLXY’s crypto business model makes a lot of sense, and their future data center revenue isn’t priced in at all. Risk factors like fluctuations in BTC price are primarily short-term, while growth factors are primarily long term. My positions are (by market value) 70% shares, 10% 9/26/25 $25 calls, and 20% 1/16/26 $35 calls. Dollar amount isn't a lot for WSB, but this represents \\~20% of my total liquid investment portfolio.\n",

      "\n",
      "Right before I posted this, I stumbled upon a post by a user “Europe2016” in WSB from 2 months ago, also about GLXY. He brings up some really good points, such as the credentials and successes of the CEO, Mike Novogratz, Galaxy having the 7^(th) largest BTC treasury in the world, and a leak from twitter using satellite imagery suggesting that Galaxy is preparing for a Helios 2. Given that there is still no news coverage about this, it has not in any way been priced in.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "The volatility and downswing for GLXY in the last month is likely due to its correlation with BTC dropping from $125k to $110k. However, given that this will only be a small part of Galaxy’s business, and it is a temporary swing, now is a great buying opportunity.\n",
